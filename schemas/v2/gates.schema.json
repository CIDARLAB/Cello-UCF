For example, all RBS variants of a certain repressor (B1_BM3R1, B2_BM3R1, B3_BM3R1) would belong to the same group (BM3R1), since a repressor is can only be used once per circuit assignment. Furthermore, if known cross-talking interactions between different repressors are known, these could also be put into the same group. Similarly, if homologous recombination is a concern and two gates have the same large part, then they can be placed in the same group."
